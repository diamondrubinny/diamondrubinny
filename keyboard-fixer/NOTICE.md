# Third-party data

`extension/src/data/en.txt` and `extension/src/data/he.txt` are filtered word lists derived from
**FrequencyWords** (https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords), built from OpenSubtitles 2018 data.
The data is published under CC BY-SA 4.0 (verify the current license in the upstream repository
before any public distribution). The lists are used only locally for deciding whether a typed word is a
valid word; nothing is sent anywhere. Regenerate with `extension/scripts/build-dicts.mjs`.
